The benchmark S&P 500 index delivered roughly a 25% total\\nreturn for 2024 (around +23% in price terms)\\n. This marked the second consecutive year of over 20% returns for the S&P 500 - a feat not\\nobserved since the late 1990s\\n. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outpaced the broader market, jumping nearly 29% for the year\\n. In contrast, smaller-cap stocks had more modest performance: the S&P 500 Equal-Weight index\\nand the Russell 2000 (small-cap benchmark) each rose about 10-11% in 2024\\n. The disparity underscored that 2024\\'s rally was not evenly distributed across the market. A key\\ntheme was the dominance of mega-cap technology stocks. A group of seven powerhouse\\ncompanies often dubbed the \"Magnificent 7\" - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta\\n(Facebook), Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively surged by roughly 64-67% on average in 2024\\n. These few firms contributed disproportionately to the S&P 500\\'s gains. In fact, they accounted for\\nover half of the index\\'s return for the year (about 54% of S&P 500 performance)\\n. By year\\'s end, many of these leaders had reached record-high share prices amid investor\\nenthusiasm for transformative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). Meanwhile, more\\ntraditional and value-oriented sectors lagged behind, and many diversified portfolios trailed the\\nS&P\\'s 25% gain as a result\\n. Overall, 2024\\'s market climate was one of bullish sentiment driven by technology and growth\\nstocks, albeit with narrow market breadth focused on the largest companies.\\nMajor Tech Stock Performances\\nApple Inc.

The iPhone maker\\'s share price reached new all-time highs, ending the year around $252 per\\nshare (up from about $185 at the start of 2024). This rally lifted Apple\\'s market capitalization to\\nnearly $4 trillion by year-end\\n, reaffirming its status as the world\\'s most valuable publicly traded company. Apple\\'s gains were\\ndriven by solid demand for its products - the company saw successful launches of the iPhone 15\\nseries and other hardware updates - as well as continued growth in high-margin services. The\\ncompany also expanded its presence in emerging markets, fueling investor optimism about future\\ngrowth. Despite only moderate earnings increases in 2024 (Apple\\'s net income grew in the high\\nsingle digits), the stock\\'s rapid appreciation led to an expansion in valuation. By the end of 2024\\nApple was trading at about 40 times its trailing earnings\\nmacrotrends.net\\n, well above its historical average P/E in the mid-20s. This elevated P/E ratio reflected substantial\\noptimism from investors and a willingness to pay a premium for Apple\\'s steady cash flows and\\necosystem advantages. In short, Apple\\'s combination of robust stock price growth and relatively\\nmodest earnings growth pushed its valuation to a lofty level going into 2025.\\nAlphabet (Google) (GOOGL) - 2024 Performance\\nAlphabet Inc., the parent of Google, also delivered strong results for shareholders in 2024.\\nAlphabet\\'s stock price rose by nearly 40% over the year\\n, closing around $189 per share - close to record highs for the company.

Key to this rally was Alphabet\\'s core strength in digital advertising (still a major\\nrevenue driver) and its strides in artificial intelligence. The company demonstrated innovation in AI,\\nincluding the introduction of its Gemini 2.0 AI model and breakthroughs in quantum computing chips\\n, which reassured investors that Google \"still has its mojo\" in the evolving tech landscape.

On\\nthe retail side, demand remained solid - Amazon's online shopping volumes and Prime membership\\nbase continued to grow, even as consumers navigated a post-pandemic environment. Meanwhile,\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud division, maintained its leadership and high\\nprofitability in the cloud computing market, benefiting from the digital transformation and AI needs of\\nbusinesses. These dual engines (e-commerce and cloud) reassured investors of Amazon's\\nlong-term growth trajectory. Crucially, Amazon's earnings improved significantly in 2024 after a\\nslump in 2022-2023.

In the process, Meta\\'s market capitalization climbed back above the $1 trillion threshold - a\\nremarkable turnaround after the company\\'s challenges just two years prior.

This sizable annual rise belies the volatility Tesla faced during the year: in the first half of 2024,\\nTesla's stock actually declined amid concerns about slowing EV demand and tighter profit margins.\\nBy mid-year, shares were down substantially from their late-2023 levels, as the company cut vehicle\\nprices to stoke demand (pressuring its margins).

The election outcome (which resulted in a more business-friendly administration) bolstered market\\nsentiment, particularly for high-growth and tech names.

Nonetheless, 2024 demonstrated the market's willingness to bet on Tesla's\\nlong-term growth story (in areas like autonomous driving, energy storage, and global EV adoption),\\neven if in the short term the financial results did not justify the exuberant stock price. Tesla's 63%\\ngain was a significant contributor to the S&P 500's performance and exemplified the late-year\\nrisk-on fervor that characterized the market's finish to 2024.\\nHigh-Growth Tech Startups and Noteworthy Stock Movers\\nBeyond the established giants, 2024 also featured eye-popping gains in a number of high-growth\\ntech companies and recent startups, both in the U.S. and internationally. Perhaps the most striking\\nexample was Palantir Technologies (PLTR), a data analytics and AI software firm. Palantir's stock\\nsoared by about 340% in 2024, making it the single best-performing stock in the S&P 500 index for\\nthe year\\n. Palantir began 2024 at a relatively low base (its shares had languished in prior years), but investor\\nsentiment flipped dramatically as the company showed its first profitable quarters and positioned\\nitself as a key player in artificial intelligence for government and enterprise. By the end of 2024,\\nPalantir's share price had climbed into the mid-$20s from single-digit levels a year earlier. This\\nenormous rally was fueled in part by excitement over Palantir's AI platforms and speculation that\\nincreased government spending on defense and data intelligence (in a more geopolitically tense\\nenvironment) would benefit the company. It's worth noting that a considerable portion of Palantir's\\n2024 gains came late in the year, during the broad tech rally in Q4. The stock, however, remained\\nvolatile, and its valuation by year-end - well above 20 times sales - reflected very high expectations\\nfor future growth. Another notable high-growth winner was IonQ (IONQ), a U.S.-based quantum\\ncomputing startup. IonQ's stock price finished 2024 up about 237% for the year\\n.

Like many\\nearly-stage tech firms, IonQ remained unprofitable, but in 2024 the market showed a willingness to\\noverlook current losses and focus on the long-term potential of quantum computing. By year-end,\\nIonQ's market cap had swelled to several billion dollars, a sign of the speculative fervor in certain\\nniche tech areas. It's worth mentioning that IonQ shares experienced a steep pullback in early 2025\\nafter their 2024 run-up, illustrating the risk that accompanies such explosive stock moves\\n. Still, in the context of 2024, IonQ was a prime example of how smaller tech innovators rode the\\nwave of optimism around next-generation technologies. On the international front, one of the most\\nsignificant tech stock stories was Arm Holdings (ARM). Arm, a British-based semiconductor IP and\\nchip design company, returned to the public markets with a highly anticipated IPO in late 2023. In\\n2024, Arm's stock gained about 64% for the full year\\n, as investors rallied around its unique position in the chip industry. Arm's designs are used in\\nvirtually all smartphone processors and increasingly in data center and AI accelerators, giving it a\\ncritical role in the semiconductor ecosystem. The stock's strong performance in 2024 - it rose from\\nits IPO price in the low $50s to around $80-$90 by year-end - was driven by optimism about Arm's\\ngrowth prospects in AI, Internet-of-Things devices, and automotive chips. Notably, Arm's share price\\nmore than doubled in the first half of 2024 amid a burst of post-IPO enthusiasm, though it later\\nsettled back after some profit-taking\\n. By the end of the year, Arm's market capitalization was around $120 billion, making it one of the\\nlargest tech companies in Europe.

The exuberance of 2024 did create a\\n\"frothy\" sentiment environment, as analysts at Schwab noted\\n, meaning investors had become very bullish and perhaps complacent. This backdrop raised some\\nconcern that volatility could return if the anticipated growth failed to materialize or if macroeconomic\\nfactors turned unfriendly.
